## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The basic structure of an accordion, with elements inside of elements.

Using `parentNode` to select the parent node. In this case:

```html
<div class="question-answer-accordion">
          <div class="question">
            <h3>Can I cancel my subscription?</h3>
            <img class='arrow' src='./images/icon-arrow-down.svg' />
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            Yes! Send us a message and weâ€™ll process your request no questions asked.
          </div>
</div>

<!-- 
  select all the .question class by using querySelectorAll, and using parentNode to target .question-answer-accordion
-->
```
